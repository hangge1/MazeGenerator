# MazeGenerator
This is a sample project for me to learn and test the maze generation algorithm. The project uses C++and EasyX libraries for visual verification. Currently, two algorithms are available: the first is randomized DFS, and the second is Prim algorithm. The screenshots are as follows:



blank is wall,  white is path



**1 dfs**
